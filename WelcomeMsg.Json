				"text1": "GENERAL RULES (In game and Discord) \\n\\n*NOTE: DONATING DOES NOT PUT YOU ABOVE THE RULES YOU CAN AND WILL BE PUNISHED SHOULD YOU BREAK ANY RULES* \\n\\n1. Be respectful. \\nYou may not like someone but at least treat them respectfully. Being an ass for no reason isn't acceptable. \\n\\nOn Discord you will be warned, if that doesn't work you will be timed out/muted for up to 3 hours, should you continue past that you will be timed out for up to 72 hours/3 days, if for whatever reason you decide to continue past this then you may be banned from the server. \\n\\nIn game you will be warned through text chat, if this fails you will be kicked from the server. \\nUse of slurs, telling people to kill themself or racism will result in immediate timeout/mute and in extreme cases bans. \\n\\n2. Do not spam chats. \\n Spamming is sending multiple messages in quick succession generally with the intent to flood chats and make it difficult for others to use it. \\n\\nOn Discord: you will be warned and messages cleared, then Timed Out/muted for up to 3 hours, second violation will be timed out up to 72 hours/3 days if you continue after that you may be banned from the Discord. \\n\\nIn game: You will be warned through text chat, if that fails you will be kicked from the server. \\n\\n3. Do not backseat admin. \\nNow this doesn't mean if you see somebody doing something not allowed to not say anything, this means if an Admin is dealing with a situation and you have nothing of value to add or important context then do not get involved. If you have concerns, take it up with that admin after the fact. \\nPunishments: Warning, Timeout 3 hours, time out 72 hours/3 days \\n\\n4. Use of cheating/exploiting is strictly prohibited. \\n This includes meshing (building under map mesh to hide/protect things.) If it is discovered you used cheats you will be banned period. \\n\\nDiscovery of a base violating the mesh rules will result in a TRIBE WIPE! Meaning admins will COMPLETELY DELETE ALL STRUCTURES AND DINOS on the map.",

				"title2": "<TextStyle.Red>Rules Continued</>",
				"text2": "5. Do not block spawn zones. \\nThis means you cannot build walls, place turrets or have player aggressive dinos in player spawn areas with the purpose of killing or trapping players when they spawn. \\n\\nPunishments; Warning with removal of structures or dinos in violation (up to 2), continued violations will result in a Tribe Wipe \\n\\n6. Do not block Obs or vital spots. \\nObs and areas used for transferring servers or activating boss fights are Neutral grounds, all players are free to access them to move from server to server within the cluster.  Blocking them is not allowed. \\n\\nStructures and/or creatures in violation will be removed and warnings issued, if after 2 warnings you continue to do so you will be wiped. \\n\\n7. Character Rules. \\nNo default character names like Bob, Human, Mensch etc. \\nNo names allowed that are racist, sexist, homophobic, or mock any disability. \\nCharacter names must be individual. \\nAdmins reserve the right to change player names that don’t follow the laws to whatever they choose. \\n\\n8. Tribe Laws. \\nPlease create a tribe name, even if playing as an individual \\nNo tribe names allowed that are racist, sexist, homophobic, or mock any disability, direct an insult towards other tribes, or copy an existing tribe name. \\nTribe names must be consistent across all maps \\nInsiding is very difficult to prove and for admins to settle. \\n Tribes should exercise caution regarding who they allow into tribe. Admins will assist if possible, but options are limited. \\n\\n9. Flag Rules \\nFlag colors will change on the 1st of each month. The new flag color will be announced prior to the change. Wipe Day wilyl occur no sooner than the 7th day of the month. Any bases found that have not changed flags by Wipe Day will be considered inactive and will be wiped. \\nIf you are suffering an event outside of your control and cannot log in to change your flags, please put in a ticket to alert admins. \\nplease place flags at your teleporters.",
				"title3": "<TextStyle.Red>Rules Continued</>",
				"text3": "10. Base Laws \\nSize, base must fit within a dino Leash \\nTribes are allowed two bases per map \\nBases may not be built in high resource zones, artifact caves, rare dino spawn areas, or Fjordur rune locations. \\nDo not build within render distance of any other player, obelisk, community center, or community TP. Admins reserve the right to ask any player to move or reduce base size to comply. \\nTP pads should not be placed anywhere other than players’ bases and MUST be on public. \\nBases are limited to a maximum of 2 Ocean or Tree Platform, and up to 8 Cliff platforms. Render rule still applies for platform use. \\nNo fencing your base with gates this is classed as spam and will be removed, if you must protect your base then please use turrets \\nNo building on Carno Island. \\n\\n11. Dino Laws \\nRecommended dino limit: No more than 20 out at a time. More may be allowed as long as your base is not laggy. Less may be requested if they are causing lag. Request cryo pods if needed. \\nAbsolutely no offline breeding. This is a serious offense and will result in a loss of dinos. \\nDo not leave dinos on aggressive or wandering unless positively contained. \\nUnwanted dinos must be unclaimed. Please do not abandon tamed dinos in the wild. \\n\\n12. Server Currency \\nThe Currency is Bushberry seeds(BBS) \\nAnd Shop Tokens. You can, exchange BBS for shop tokens I your crafting menu. \\n\\n13.PLAYER MAILBOXES \\nA mailbox allows admin to deliver items when you are not online. If you purchased something from the Admin Shop, we can deliver it securely to you. \\nOne mailbox per player/tribe, at your Main base. \\nPlease place mailbox at your teleporter. \\nAnd open ticket with admin to register mailbox and give us the pin.\\n\\nWe recommend having a vault and cryofridge."
